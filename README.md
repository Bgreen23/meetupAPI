#Meetup API

This shows your upcoming Meetup events and places a pin on the map at their location. If you click on the pin, you will get more information about that specific Meetup.
In order to get this code to work for you, you'll have to replace anything that says `placeholder` and add your Meetup/Mapbox information.
